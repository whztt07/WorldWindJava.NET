   * The listener interface for receiving keyboard events (keystrokes).
   * The class that is interested in processing a keyboard event
   * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
   * contains) or extends the abstract <code>KeyAdapter</code> class
   * (overriding only the methods of interest).
   * <P>
   * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
   * component using the component's <code>addKeyListener</code>
   * method. A keyboard event is generated when a key is pressed, released,
   * or typed. The relevant method in the listener
   * object is then invoked, and the <code>KeyEvent</code> is passed to it.
